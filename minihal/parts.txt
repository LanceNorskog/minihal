test
 given blob class, supply to EL type
 fetch:
   top level
   array lookup
   iterate array members as callable iterator
 supply request.param list to EL as 'request'

 annotation implementation
 dynamic proxy test
   parse annotations and prepare request & response objects supplied to EL
   simple action w/o EL, top and embedded
   actions w EL at lop and embedded
 all actions after method, nothing before, so possible to test in Groovy and Scala
 two variants: get an object, parse a string, need two code bases to iterate structure.
 supply EL data from 'request' and 'response'. don't need q= from response to create another search link



decide
  which el engine to use
  how to supply params and response to EL in type-safe way
  need to get array and feed parts to EL in embedded
  need class?
  two options: get class or json blob or both?
      class first, then blob. or just ignore blob because needs dual implementation
